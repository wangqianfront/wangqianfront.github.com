	<h2>Welcome to PTAF/GrinderBox - the PEG Performance Test Automation Framework</h2>
<p>PEG is short for Performance Engineering Group, which is a team under SSTZ OoA. The team focuses on R&D in performance engineering area. The research includes software performance related processes, methodologies and tools. The team also participates in many real performance projects. After more than one year's hard work, the team established the preliminary performance engineering process, practised performance testing process. The team mastered various methodologies for performance testing such as workload modeling, performance bottleneck diagnosis etc. </p>

<p>The team evaluated many performance tools such as LoadRunner, JMeter, Grinder etc and found that both commercial tools and open source tools have their drawbacks. The drawbacks mainly include weakness in customization for specific appliactions, inability to construct workload easily, table based description of business scenarios etc. And nevertheless, it is still too costly to purchase commercial tools, and also the tool itself requires much efforts before one can use it freely. </p>

<p>So this is why PTAF comes into being. The team decided to enhance existing tools - the Grinder. The Grinder tool is rather a load generator than a performance testing tool. It creates load on target server by issuing concurrent virtual users of a particular kind of protocol and collects performance data such as response time/throughput for further analysis.The enhancement doesn't mean to modify the Grinder tool's source code directly but to build accessory tools that are: script modeler, scenario builder, grinder runtime support and data analyzer. With this tool, user can generate executable asset directory for Grinder to run. After the results come out, the data analyzer will help the user to perform an overall analysis. </p>

<p>Starting from version 1.0, PTAF has been renamed to GrinderBox as its new release name. It supports debugging scripts in Eclipse environment thus makes creating performance testing scripts easier.</p>


<p>Starting from version 1.2 PTAF is enhanced to support State Street Cloud application. Test Tutorial Video(1280*1024), Ant Task & Report System Video(1280*1024) and Tutorial has been drafted to guide users to use PTAF for cloud application benchmarking and performance testing. Cloud support FAQ. </p>

<h4>Features and Benifits</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Innovative Visualized Business Scenario Modeling</b></li>
<p>PTAF's innovation of visualized business scenario modeling no longer treats the system workload as a scequence of unorganized requests but as a combination of user behaviors into hierachical business layers.</p>


<li><b>Centralized Development Environment</b></li>
<p>Integrated with Eclipse, using Jython/Java as its programming language; PTAF can engage the overall project at a very early stage. Business analysts, architects, developers and QA can have a uniform platform to communicate about performance.</p>


<li><b>Open Source and In-house Support</b></li>
<p>PTAF is built on existing open souce tool and still it is open source itself. Contributions from users and other project teams can be easily migrated into the project. In-house support makes the use of PTAF at ease. </p>
</ul>
