						Investment Data Management & Best Practice
						Lessons learned from the recent financial crisis have been driving changes in risk management, investment compliance and financial reporting, and firms have recognized the importance of a comprehensive and consistent approach to investment data management (fund data, transactions, holdings, FX, IAS, etc). This session will talk about how to set up a good data management framework (technology), the benefits it generates and ultimately the transparency it brings through best practice.

						Frank Maltais is the regional solutions manager for Asia/Pacific at Princeton Financial Systems, a State Street company. In this role, Frank works with financial service clients primarily in the asset management & insurance industry, and also on the sell side (fund administration, custody, etc). Originally from Canada, he began his career as an international project manager for a small Canadian NGO that he set up along with 3 other members. International assignments included locations such as India, Africa (Cameroon), China, and Peru.  After working in Silicon Valley (California), he then relocated to Vienna (Austria) and joined the financial technology industry, he then became head of pre-sales for a market leading software vendor in the field of reference data, market data, and risk management solutions (AIM Software). Prior to joining Princeton Financial in 2008, Frank was a freelancer and provided services to Aquin, an award-winning provider of investment compliance and risk monitoring solutions.

Frank has now more than 10 years of experience in the financial services industry, mainly on the technology side. 
						Frank graduated from ETS in Canada (software engineering), and went on to earn a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Webster University (USA).

						This presentation will cover three case studies of Lean in IT.  Structurally, the presentation will be divided into four sections.  The first section will provide an overview of Lean.  This will include basic background information on Lean, some important concepts, and some basic tools. 
						The remaining three sections will provide case studies of the application of Lean in IT.  Each case study will highlight the concepts applied and benefits realized. There will also be information on challenges faced during the Lean work.  Case study 1 will be an example of applying Lean continuous improvement to the development of test automation software.  Case study 2 will cover an application of Lean concepts to high volume request ticket processing. It will show how Lean was used to improve customer’s experience with request ticket processing.  Case study 3 will be an example of the application of Lean to a large test department.  This is a multi-year, ongoing effort which has yielded some very good results.

						Problem Frames (PFs) is a promising approach for software requirements modeling and analysis. By focusing on problems rather than solutions, PFs drive developers to explicitly analyze and describe requirements problems in full detail. Yet, to date, this approach has attracted more attention in the academic community than in the software development industry, due to the difficulty of deriving PFs from a complex real-world problem context. To overcome this difficulty, we provide a systematic and practical approach to derive individual PFs from a complex problem. To illustrate this approach, we also introduce some real world examples extracted from an equity trading problem.

						The State Street Standard Estimating and Tracking Practice supports many of Lean’s guiding principles including elimination of waste, amplifying learning, seeing the whole and so on. This presentation introduces a transparent estimation process using five objective metrics readily available today by all project teams. Using this process and automating it through tools increases the communication level between all stakeholders and allows both business and IT to focus on the tradeoffs between scope, effort/cost, time, and quality early in the lifecycle. The benefits to this approach eliminates waste in development, increases stakeholder understanding of what is being built, and provides teams and management objective views of the whole system based on past performance using objective metrics.

						Traditionally treated as a cost, investment compliance & risk monitoring have become the top investment priority in 2011 (source: IDC). Financial institutions have traditionally spent around 10% of their IT budget on compliance, in 2011 this has increased to 20%. Driven mainly by compulsory regulations (UCITS, Sharia investments, Asian Fund Passport, etc), if done properly investment compliance can also create competitive advantages. This session will show how to set up a good investment compliance and risk monitoring framework (technology), and best practice will be shared along the way.

						IT assets such as infrastructure, software application and SDLC artifacts is the key to any modern enterprise of which the business is heavily driven by information technology. Therefore, IT asset management is very critical to large scale companies running hundreds of thousands of software applications. This session will present how an asset-centric sematic layer can be built upon Rational Asset Manager which is an asset management framework. Based on that, a scenario with bunch of asset-based applications will be provided to showcase how the solution behaves in integrating IT information and operation effectively.

						Software projects always suffer from kinds of uncertain factors. As a common strategy, contingency buffer is added to the effort estimate. So how to assess the uncertainty and monitor the contingency buffer during the project progress is always a hot topic in software management .
					In this paper, we propose an earned-value approach to assess and monitor software uncertainty. It combines the value-at-risk method in financial field and the earned-value-feedback process of earned value project management, and proposes a framework which contains value-at-uncertainty system, consumed-value-feedback system and experienced base to support in-process uncertainty measurement and contingency buffer management. Value-at-uncertainty system is used to assess the uncertainty in progress of a project, and consumed-value-feedback system is applied to provide the decision support of how to deal with the buffer at that specific time. A case study in software test execution of 24 projects is conducted to evaluate the approach. With the approach, both the accuracy and the effectiveness of uncertainty assessment can be improved along with project execution progress.
